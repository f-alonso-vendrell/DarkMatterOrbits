<h2>Newton's Law of Gravitation</h2><p align="left">One of the most studied central force problems is Newton's universal law of gravitation.&nbsp; This law states that two spherical
particles of mass M<sub>1 </sub>and M<sub>2</sub>
attracted each other with a force F<sub>12</sub> that is
inversely proportional to their separation squared and is directed
along a line connecting their centers

<p align="left">
The direction of the force on M<sub>1</sub> is indicated by
a unit vector "r-hat" pointing from M<sub>1 </sub>to M<sub>2</sub>.
The proportionality constant G depends on the system of units and takes
the value G = 6.67x10<sup>-11</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/kg<sup>.</sup>s
in the metric system.

Because two gravitationally interacting particles orbit in a plane
about their common center of mass, we choose a coordinate system
with the center of mass at the origin.&nbsp; Intermediate mechanics texts show this two-body problem can be reduced to an equivalent one-body problem so this 
inverse square law model is very general.</p>

Applying Newton's Second Law <b>F</b> = M<sub>1</sub><b>a</b>
to the orbiting mass and using units such that M<sub>2</sub>G=1
the acceleration of the orbiting mass becomes

Rewriting this vector formula using Cartesian components and
recognizing that sin(<font face="Times New Roman">&#952;</font>)
= y/r, cos(<font face="Times New Roman">&#952;</font>) =
x/r, and r = (x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>
in the plane of the orbit gives the following coupled differential
equations for input into the Ejs model.
